Good luck to all of you, in facilitating a culture that embraces change and agility among your enterprises.

Two of my favorite quotes from William Edwards Deming, a major contributor to the Toyota Production System, an inspiration to DevOps:

> "It is not necessary to change. Survival is not mandatory."

> "A system cannot understand itself. The transformation requires a view from the outside."
