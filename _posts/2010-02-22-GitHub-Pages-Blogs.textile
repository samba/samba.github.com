title: GitHub Pages & Blogs

p. Today I finally bumped my GitHub page beyond a simple placeholder. Not bad. The deployment process is quite natural to anyone with any real Git experience, but there's a bit of a learning curve for the templating and formatting systems. 

Some pages I found handy in the process:
* "Pushing a Blog with GitHub Pages and Jekyll":http://blog.envylabs.com/2009/08/publishing-a-blog-with-github-pages-and-jekyll/
* "Meta Templates for GitHub Pages":http://tagaholic.me/2009/02/19/meta-templates-for-github-pages.html
* "Tekkub's site as an example":http://github.com/tekkub/tekkub.github.com


And if you're willing to blow a few commits to get your formatting right, you don't need to download/install anything. Some of the directory structure, YAML configuration, and related takes a little getting-used-to.

Now I'm tempted to find a way to add Google Site Search and move some of my misc. knowledge into this, since it's (soon) easier to maintain...
