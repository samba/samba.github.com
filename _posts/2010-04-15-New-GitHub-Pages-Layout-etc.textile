I finally had a minute to rework my design and such. The previous draft was way too cluttered, and provided more info than most people wanted to know. 

I don't think the new draft is final, but it's an improvement. If you browse "the code":{{ page.links.ghpage }}, 
you'll see that it uses YAML more extensively to define datastructures, and then loops over them to generate content. Good stuff.

Some resources that helped me along:
