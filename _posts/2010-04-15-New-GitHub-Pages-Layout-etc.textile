I finally had a minute to rework my design and such. The previous draft was way too cluttered, and provided more info than most people wanted to know. 

I don't think the new draft is final, but it's an improvement. If you browse "the code":{{ page.links.ghpage }}, 
you'll see that it uses YAML more extensively to define datastructures, and then loops over them to generate content. Good stuff.

Some resources that helped me along:
* "Liquid for Designers":http://wiki.github.com/tobi/liquid/liquid-for-designers


Unfortunately this iteration has highlighted some problems with the Liquid templating system (and Jekyll). 
When using @\{\% for ... \%\}@ loops, it generates extra newlines - _before_ Textile processes it, apparently.
This results in separate structures; e.g. when using the '*' to produce lists, it produces a separate @&lt;ul&gt;@ for each list. The same applies to tables, one table for each row.
It has a similar effect with some variations on structure, where it translates newlines to @&lt;br&gt;@ - injecting them into a table, for example. (I've included a sample below.)

You can how problematic that becomes. 

Another issue I encountered, though somewhat less frustrating, is that the YAML parser is very sensitive to indentation characters - in particular, it seems to hate my tabs. Not nice - but I can live with it.

h3. List Break Example

	The list below is generated automatically using a @for@ loop and Textile markup.

{% for i in page.entries %}
* {{ i.name }}
{% endfor %}
