description: Having let my blog idle during some difficult years, I will now resume my efforts.

My last published post was on October 26, 2016. That's forever ago. A lot has happened since. 

I've learned tremendously in the intervening 2.5 years. From these formative lessons, I'll be publishing more on this site soon. 

Among those lessons, ironically, is that one should make a habit of writing about the things they learn, fairly promptly after they have learned them.
Writing is an exercise in forming thought into (hopefully) concrete language, which forces one to ponder and remember. 
This reinforces the neurological patterns of that learning; it's important to actively _remember_ at times. 

Unfortunately I had set a roadblock in my own path: I was rather tired of the visual layout of my site here, and had begun work (in several failed attempts) to develop a new theme. 
I've always found the _clean_ look of publications on Medium, but I've always felt leary of some of their policies. 
Finally, after much recent effort, I've crafted [a new, separate Jekyll theme][solace], specifically designed to emulate some of the feel of Medium, while publishing via GitHub pages.  (*Note* I'm still tuning the theme a bit, based on my observations on this site.)

Therefore this post serves two purposes
- Announcing the rollout of my Jekyll theme on this site, and as an independent theme that others can use for their own sites
- Declaring my intent to resume writing on some interesting subjects.

It's also come to my attention, through this process, that some of my past blogging is absolutely terrible. :thinking:
