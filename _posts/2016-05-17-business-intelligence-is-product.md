[Product integrity][1] (HBR, 1990) represents the alignment of business processes, workflow, and the production lifecycle that yield your product or service; the end result is your customers' experience of your company. Every process in your business must be oriented to delivering your _brand_ to the customer.

You cannot change what you do not understand; Business Intelligence offers that understanding, of the business's operations, strategic positioning, and your market. Business Intelligence enables the pursuit of [product and organizational integrity][1].

Unfortunately, [many companies][2] still [struggle to build significant user-adoption][3] of their business intelligence platforms. Many [approaches][4] have been [proposed][5] to improve adoption and overall success of BI endeavors, however they miss the larger context of _integrity_.

Successful business intelligence investments require another layer of product-thinking: that the BI platform is itself a product, to be managed in kind, and it lays the foundation of [product integrity][1] for the enterprise.

Ultimately you want:

- Users across the organization to use the platform, evolve their business operations, and report their success.
- Prospective users to have an easy on-ramp into the platform, and find useful insights.
- Sophisticated users to find value in the platform's capabilities, and propose improvements.

This requires a product paradigm;

- The outcome of the user's experience will enable organizational change.
- The user's needs will evolve; the platform must be flexible and adaptible.
- The organization entails many different kinds of users; these represent market segments, requiring different features and capabilities.
- Users will need support systems, documentation, and training.
- Adoption will require BI evangelism, advocacy, and integration with many teams, each responding best to a unique marketing message.
- Understanding the success of the BI platform _itself_ requires metrics, and its value described in terms of _pricing_.
- The platform must launch with a minimum-viable set of features and data sets, as quickly as possible.

When your BI teams start thinking in product development, the _product vision_ becomes [organizational integrity][1], as the paradigm drives an _essential requirement_ of sharing and collaboration, to enable the cross-functional evolution that supports innovation for the customer.

Delivering on all this is nontrivial, but absolutely feasible even with small teams. I'll save that for a future post.

Yes, I recognize that I've cited an article that's now 25 years old, in an industry that evolves monthly. The fundamentals still stand.
