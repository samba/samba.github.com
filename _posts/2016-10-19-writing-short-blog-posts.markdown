    Finding the optimal *length* of a blog post is tricky, and depends on your subject matter, your audience, and
    the purpose of your publication. I've turned up a few _solid recommendations_ for targeting Social media, organic search, and reader engagement with different formats.

## How long should my blog posts be?

I've got several drafts in progress right now on various topics.

It turns out it's really hard to write *short* blog posts, at least on relatively technical subjects. From some quick research though, maybe that's OK.

[Neil Patel suggests][1] that writing 3000+ words in a blog post is OK, and while shorter posts may gain some immediate popularity, longer-form content also has longer-term value, provided it's oriented to "evergreen" topics and formats.

[Joe Bunting also remarks][2] that content should have a _purpose_, the goals of which should dictate the resulting format.

As a quick guideline, based on your goals,

- More comments, keep the post **under** 275 words
- More social shares, target somewhere between 600 and 1,250 words.
- More organic search, aim for _more_ than 2,450 words.

Neil's remarks on "evergreen" content align nicely with the goal of organic search, highlighting longer formats based on:

> - How-to Guides
> - Resource Lists + Reviews
> - Unchanging stances on industry issues
> - Frequently-asked-questions collections
> - Industry definitions

So I think I'm OK: my content tends to be fairly technical in nature, and I naturally tend to longer-form, lending to more advantage in the organic search category. I'll continue to train myself to the thresholds above, based on content goals, when needed.
