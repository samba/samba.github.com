## Abstract

Our election process, two-party system, and media involvement is (perhaps
accidentally) a rigged game. It's time we proactively make change, as
the competitive environment of the two parties is doing us more harm than good.
We have a duty to society, our own descendants, to stop voting for "lesser"
evils and start voting for good.

This is a political reflection; I am not pushing the agenda of any party or
candidate in this piece, only considering the state of our society and process.
I welcome open discussion on how to improve our society going forward.
I love solving problems.

**Updates in progress.** The original draft was rather long: I'm gradually
slicing it into independent documents for easier reading.

## The Lesser Evil

Several recent pieces have been published, by some quite notable persons in
our society, on the subject of [lesser evil voting][7] (LEV). In general, you
would vote the "lesser evil" when you believe there are only two options, and
both are somehow undesirable to you. This is the opposite of
[sincere voting][6].

Consideration of whether lesser evil voting is a legitimate process for our
society spans the political spectrium. [Barry Donegan][9], a libertarian,
[admits the potential impact][4] of LEV among [swing states][8], though he also
highlights the side-effects and possible benefits of [sincere voting][6]. This
represents a kind of [realpolitik][10], acknowledging the evident dynamics of
our current political theater.

Most recently, [in a recent and very eloquent brief][1], John Halle and Noam
Chomsky extol the _utilitarian_ value of lesser evil voting, especially in
[swing states][8], in pursuit of their openly stated agenda.
[Responding to criticism][2], they argue for pursuing a Democrat majority in
congress, in part to "remove a smokescreen Clinton will have available for her
inevitable failure to deliver on most of her campaign promises." Fortunately,
Halle and Chomsky eventually clarify their "optimal outcome" in 2016, both
fending off a Trump victory and (as they perceive it) catastrophic side-effects,
and solidifying the ongoing influence of a politically left segment of our
population, inspite of the neoliberal trend among the Democrat party.

Sadly the most explicit statement of utilitarian _good_ given by Halle and
Chomsky amounts to "do[ing] less evil." If we applied this thinking to the
legendary Robin Hood, that'd be like saying we should favor decisions that
_steal less from the **poor**_ - reducing the net negative, and calling it a
positive good.

Andrew Smolksi also rebutted Halle and Chomsky, in [a similarly fascinating,
and deeply concerning alignment][3] of this election's Republican and Democrat
candidates, highlighting that in regard to the "lesser evil voting" paradigm,

> It is to take the unknown and make it a bogey, when we know the known is
> already a bogey. ... In this election there is no LEV, not even slightly...
> What we are deciding is to vote for the cause or the effect. Hillary and
> neoliberalism/neoconservativism in general are the cause of the Trump-style
> authoritarian populism that now haunts the US.

In short, Smolski asserts that third-party "unknown" candidates are effectively
treated as _more evil_, even though the problems we hope to solve are largely
created by the same _evils_ we're now choosing between.

## It's a Trap

A two-party system is *necessarily* evil - as long as our attention is fixed
on only two parties, ignoring any alternatives, we'll remain subject to the
slow mutation of the party interests.

Modern U.S. political campaigns are finely-tuned marketing machines, driving to
gain the interest of voters across many different demographics, regional and
otherwise, as quickly as possible and with maximum long-term retention. To
achieve this, the marketing teams constantly study polling data, financial and
economic trends of cities and even individual families, to identify their
political concerns and "hone in" to represent those issues as priorities of a
particular candidate, in pursuit of seeming "relevant".

The saying "jack of all trades, master of none" applies here; when a campaign
is frenetically targeting all the issues and trying to reach maximum diversity,
they quickly dilute their actual message ("brand" in some sense), and begin to
lose relevance to the population as each issue's position gets publicized.
Often this targeting of each issue results in conflicting statements with
positions previously held by the candidate.
(That's also a quick way to lose trust.)

Soon we end up with distrusted, unfocused candidates whose policies are unclear,
(or even perhaps quite similar to their competition), that one could safely
call the process a "race to mediocrity." In our current political culture,
people don't want mediocrity. They [a significant slice of our population] want
champions and heroes, which require trust, consistency, and committment.

Without champions and heroes, you have duds and losers, whose motives are
questionable and whose voting records are often disagreeable to their would-be
supporters. (They call that "[party] in name only", right?)

So the choices, to most voters, now appear to be "loser 1" versus "loser 2", and
the singular choice is to waste four, maybe eight years on an agenda that will
probably have unforeseen negative side effects and wasn't what the voter wanted
anyway. They may even be seen as catastrophic. Real problems won't get solved.
It's hard not to call that evil, considering the atrocious _waste_ of time and
money compared to the needs of our local problems.

Why then do we tolerate a system that intrinsicly produces "evil"?

_Update_ [2016-10]: a relative of mine, whose political alignment differs from
mine, and whom I greatly respect, pointed out that many of us **do not** want
heroes as our politicians. In stead, some would prefer to see intelligent,
thoughtful, and deliberate leadership to materially influence global dynamics. I
would also certainly prefer that, and this point is greatly appreciated, however
I'd gamble to say that the ongoing support among the political right for Donald
Trump demonstrates the desire for a champion (causes aside), among a significant
slice of our voting population.

## Gaming the System

We have, in our culture, a destructively competitive political discourse. This
is a psychological phenomenon, well understood by [game theory][12], a byproduct
of disparate information, [false choices][17], and perceived but imaginary threats.

There are two dominant categories of voters, and each voter must choose:

- I'm with Category A
- I'm with Category B
- I'll waste my vote  (I'd rather be possibly irrelevant)
- I'll just not vote  (I am irrelevant)

The specific risks and social penalties associated with each choice differ by
voter. We observe in this system 40% to 50% of voters opt out of voting. In recent
estimates, approximately 30% of (polled) voters are willing to "waste" their
votes.

The "lesser evil" thinking fundamentally pits Category A versus Category B, and
produces the "waste my vote" perception. There can be social penalties to any
vote for Categories A or B, or "wasting" it on another option, whereas
(currently) the social penalty for not voting is effectively nil.

Further, because common "lesser evil" mantra would effectively "blame" the
[sincere][6] third-party votes for any catastrophe of the winning Category A
or Category B, the social penalty of "wasting" the vote is (in terms of risk)
the same as voting for the "greater evil" in such a scenario. Most people would
prefer to avoid that blame by voting "in favor" of the lesser evil, inspite of
misgivings that might lend a [sincere][6] favor to a third-party option.

When the risks associated with the two dominant categories approach equality,
the third-party "wasted" vote becomes more attractive, as there is no
differential social cost to voting third-party. Without a differential benefit
between the two dominant categories, the perceived benefits of voting
third-party become subjectively greater.

This "game" is governed, somewhat loosely, by media. Information conveyed about
the state of our political process, significance of any particular candidate,
their respective policies and positions influences the perception of each among
the various subcultures in our nation. News networks are well-known to focus
coverage on the issues they know their viewership is most concerned with.
[Parties evidently][13] [influence the media][14] as well, sometimes through
means that are socially unacceptable if not illegal.

Voter behavior is thus influenced by perception of any two options that are in
the media spotlight (that [false choice][17]), at the whims of the parties it
seems. The parties choose their prospects, work with media to spread the right
message at the right time, and let the voters choose the candidate they fear
least.

Control the options and you control the choices. Marketing indeed.

## Fighting The Greater Evil

Notable among [Halle and Chomsky's remarks][1], I found this mind-bending assertion:

> what needs to be challenged is the assumption that voting should be seen a
> form of individual self-expression rather than as an act to be judged on its
> likely consequences

I can see their point: that such expression has consequences that must be
considered.

Perhaps Halle and Chomsky would call me a "moral witness," but provided the
[reasoning of Smolski][3] about our current two major candidates being equally
catastrophic, the consequences may not differ much. [Update 2016-10] Surely their
policies differ in extreme, aligned with their interests and sponsors, however
the negative externalities of either choice [would seem comparable][3].

Therefore the moral component is due for consideration: if our system of media,
lobbying, campaign finance, and political process is corrupted by the influence
of two-party thinking (indeed [the parties themselves][15]), and our "lesser evil"
approach continually exacerbates the problem-state of our society, then we
have a moral duty to seek alternatives.

Systemic shifts are going to be profoundly difficult to implement, so we should
focus on making consistent, but (relatively) small improvements.
[Halle and Chomsky][2] correctly regard the [sincere][6] vote against
[corruption][13] as important in this capacity, however improvement must have
observable effects. Per the agenda of the left, which Halle, Chomsky, and
Smolski cite, this should yield some distinct change in fossil fuel consumption,
military budgets, and quantifiable components of climate change policy
*implementation*.  We have to actually _solve problems_, even if perhaps
incrementally.

Local and state elections matter even more: the governing principles of our
nation are maintained in frequent sessions of Congress.
Remember that it is _we_ who elect them, who give them power. _We_ have a duty
to influence the political system in the direction _we ultimately want_, rather
than the direction we fear the least.

The [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact][16] is also a good sign: in time
perhaps we will see a political culture with less stifling of the public will.

One can only hope - not fear.
