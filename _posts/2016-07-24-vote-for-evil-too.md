**NOTE** this post is going to be restructured into a series soon.

This is a political reflection; I am not pushing the agenda of any party or 
candidate in this piece, only considering the state of our society and process.
I would hope for you to do the same, and open discussion with me on how to
improve our society going forward. I love solving problems.

## The Lesser Evil

Several recent pieces have been published, by some quite notable persons in
our society, on the subject of [lesser evil voting][7] (LEV). In general, you 
would vote the "lesser evil" when you believe there are only two options, and 
both are somehow undesirable to you. This is the opposite of 
[sincere voting][6].

Consideration of whether lesser evil voting is a legitimate process for our 
society spans the political spectrium. [Barry Donegan][9], a libertarian, 
[admits the potential impact][4] of LEV among [swing states][8], though he also
highlights the side-effects and possible benefits of [sincere voting][6]. This 
represents a kind of [realpolitik][10], acknowledging the evident dynamics of
our current political theater.

Most recently, [in a recent and very eloquent brief][1], John Halle and Noam
Chomsky extol the _utilitarian_ value of lesser evil voting, especially in 
[swing states][8], in pursuit of their openly stated agenda. 
[Responding to criticism][2], they argue for pursuing a Democrat majority in 
congress, in part to "remove a smokescreen Clinton will have available for her 
inevitable failure to deliver on most of her campaign promises." Fortunately, 
Halle and Chomsky eventually clarify their "optimal outcome" in 2016, both 
fending off a Trump victory and (as they perceive it) catastrophic side-effects, 
and solidifying the ongoing influence of a politically left segment of our 
population, inspite of the neoliberal trend among the Democrat party. 

Sadly the most explicit statement of utilitarian _good_ given by Halle and
Chomsky amounts to "do[ing] less evil." If we applied this thinking to the
legendary Robin Hood, that'd be like saying we should favor decisions that
_steal less from the *poor*_. Reducing the net negative, and calling it a
positive good.

Andrew Smolksi also rebutted Halle and Chomsky, in [a similarly fascinating, 
and deeply concerning alignment][3] of this election's Republican and Democrat 
candidates, highlighting that in regard to the "lesser evil voting" paradigm, 

> It is to take the unknown and make it a bogey, when we know the known is 
> already a bogey. ... In this election there is no LEV, not even slightly...
> What we are deciding is to vote for the cause or the effect. Hillary and 
> neoliberalism/neoconservativism in general are the cause of the Trump-style 
> authoritarian populism that now haunts the US.

In short, Smolski asserts that third-party "unknown" candidates are effectively
treated as _more evil_, even though the problems we hope to solve are largely
created by the same _evils_ we're now choosing between.

## It's a Trap

A two-party system is *necessarily* evil - as long as our attention is fixed
on only two parties, ignoring any alternatives, we'll remain subject to the
slow mutation of the party interests. 

Modern U.S. political campaigns are finely-tuned marketing machines, driving to
gain the interest of voters across many different demographics, regional and 
otherwise, as quickly as possible and with maximum long-term retention. To 
achieve this, the marketing teams constantly study polling data, financial and
economic trends of cities and even individual families, to identify their 
political concerns and "hone in" to represent those issues as priorities of a
particular candidate, in pursuit of seeming "relevant".

The saying "jack of all trades, master of none" applies here; when a campaign
is frenetically targeting all the issues and trying to reach maximum diversity, 
they quickly dilute their actual message ("brand" in some sense), and begin to
lose relevance to the population as each issue's position gets publicized. 
Often this targeting of each issue results in conflicting statements with 
positions previously held by the candidate. 
(That's also a quick way to lose trust.)

Soon we end up with distrusted, unfocused candidates whose policies are unclear,
(or even perhaps quite similar to their competition), that one could safely
call the process a "race to mediocrity." In our current political culture, 
people don't want mediocrity. They want champions and heroes, which require 
trust, consistency, and committment.

Without champions and heroes, you have duds and losers, whose motives are 
questionable and whose voting records are often disagreeable to their would-be
supporters. (They call that "[party] in name only", right?)

So the choices, to most voters, now appear to be "loser 1" versus "loser 2", and
the singular choice is to waste four, maybe eight years on an agenda that will
probably have unforeseen negative side effects and wasn't what the voter wanted
anyway. They may even be seen as catastrophic. Real problems won't get solved.
It's hard not to call that evil, considering the atrocious _waste_ of time and 
money compared to the needs of our local problems.

Why then do we tolerate a system that intrinsicly produces "evil"?

## Gaming the System

This is a psychological phenomenon, well understood by [game theory][12]. Things
get a little abstract in here, but bear with me. 
(See also: [Introduction to Game Theory](#appendix-introduction-to-game-theory))
The abstraction is intentional, as it applies within parties too, not just in 
the federal election.

There are two dominant categories of voters, and each voter must choose:

- I'm with Category A
- I'm with Category B
- I'll waste my vote  (I'd rather be possibly irrelevant)
- I'll just not vote  (I am irrelevant)

The specific risks and social penalties associated with each choice differ by 
voter. We observe in this system 40% to 50% of voters opt out of voting. In recent 
estimates, approximately 30% of (polled) voters are willing to "waste" their 
votes. 

The "lesser evil" thinking fundamentally pits Category A versus Category B, and
produces the "waste my vote" perception. There can be social penalties to any 
vote for Categories A or B, or "wasting" it on another option, whereas 
(currently) the social penalty for not voting is effectively nil. 

Further, because common "lesser evil" mantra would effectively "blame" the
[sincere][6] third-party votes for any catastrophe of the winning Category A
or Category B, the social penalty of "wasting" the vote is (in terms of risk)
the same as voting for the "greater evil" in such a scenario.

Typically, most people would avoid that blame, and attempt to avoid the greater
evil by voting "in favor" of the lesser evil, inspite of misgivings that might
lend a [sincere][6] favor to a third-party option.

When the risks associated with the two dominant categories approach equality,
the third-party "wasted" vote becomes more attractive, as there is no 
differential social cost to voting third-party. Without a differential benefit
between the two dominant categories, the perceived benefits of voting 
third-party become subjectively greater.

This "game" is governed, somewhat loosely, by media. Information conveyed about
the state of our political process, significance of any particular candidate, 
their respective policies and positions influences the perception of each among
the various subcultures in our nation. News networks are well-known to focus
coverage on the issues they know their viewership is most concerned with. 
[Parties evidently][13] [influence the media][14] as well, sometimes through
means that are socially unacceptable if not illegal. 

Voter behavior is thus influenced by perception of any two options that are in
the media spotlight, at the whims of the parties it seems. The parties choose
their prospects, work with media to spread the right message at the right time,
and let the voters choose the candidate they fear least.

Control the options and you control the choices. Marketing indeed.

## Fighting The Greater Evil

Notable among [Halle and Chomsky's remarks][1], I found this mind-bending assertion:

> what needs to be challenged is the assumption that voting should be seen a 
> form of individual self-expression rather than as an act to be judged on its 
> likely consequences

I can see their point: that such expression has consequences that must be 
considered.

Perhaps Halle and Chomsky would call me a "moral witness," but provided the
[reasoning of Smolski][3] about our current two major candidates being equally 
catastrophic, the consequences may not differ much.

Therefore the moral component is due for consideration: if our system of media,
lobbying, campaign finance, and political process is corrupted by the influence
of two-party thinking (indeed the parties themselves), and our "lesser evil"
approach continually exacerbates the problem-state of our society, then we
have a moral duty to seek alternatives.

Systemic shifts are going to be profoundly difficult to implement, so we should
focus on making consistent, but (relatively) small improvements. 
[Halle and Chomsky][2] correctly regard the [sincere][6] vote against 
[corruption][13] as important in this capacity, however improvement must have
observable effects. Per the agenda of the left, which Halle, Chomsky, and 
Smolski cite, this should yield some distinct change in fossil fuel consumption,
military budgets, and quantifiable components of climate change policy 
*implementation*.  We have to actually _solve problems_, even if perhaps 
incrementally.

Local and state elections matter even more: the governing principles of our 
nation are maintained in frequent sessions of Congress. 
Remember that it is _we_ who elect them, who give them power. _We_ have a duty
to influence the political system in the diretion _we ultimately want_, rather
than fear the least.

The [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact][16] is also a good sign: in time
perhaps we will see a political culture with less stifling of the public will.

One can only hope - not fear.

## Appendix: Introduction to Game Theory

[Game theory][12] is the science of understanding behavior among multiple 
decision-makers in any system of rules.

In the classic [Prisoner's Dilemna][11], two suspects are asked to divulge 
incriminating information about the other in exchange for a reduced penalty.
Each has the option of remaining silent. There's no communication permitted 
between the suspects: they must act speculatively, judging the other suspect's
motives and character, while evaluating their own subjective risk/reward model.

This is usually modeled as a matrix:

|          |B: divulge   |B: silent    |
|A: divulge| 2x each     | A: 3x; B: 0 |
|A: silent | A: 0; B: 3x | 1x each     |
{:.border}

* If both divulge, they each get 2 years imprisonment as penalty.
* If just one divulges, he receives no penalty, and the other receives 3 years.
* If both remain silent, both receive a 1 year penalty.

Traditionally the interpretation of this exercise is that agents (i.e. suspects
or prisoners) act based on subjective evaluation of the same matrix, albeit
perhaps subconsciously, and that their behaviors can be influenced by altering
the risk/reward model.

It's worth noting that to the prison, in terms of total time served (in 
"man years"), the model looks like so:

|          |B: divulge |B: silent |
|A: divulge| 4 M.Y.    | 3 M.Y.   |
|A: silent | 3 M.Y.    | 2 M.Y.   |
{:.border}

Assuming the prison somehow benefits from maximizing total penalties, it's in
the prison's interest to motivate each suspect to divulge out of supposed self-
interest. In this microcosmic example, some might argue that the whole society
shares the prison's interests.
