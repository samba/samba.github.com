p(. So I guess this is a site about me and the things I work on... A lot of information is available about me on the web already, so if you're really curious, feel free to search.

p(. So far I've been: (sr) systems engineer, software developer, IT Analyst 1, student - among others.

p(. Lately I'm thinking about breaking out and exploring some humanitarian interests. I see myself as a problem solver, so I'm considering logistics, communications, and other facets of running worldwide organizations. (If you know of openings or have ideas, please do contact me.)

<div id='projects'>
h2. Projects
p(. There are many... (I'll update this in the next revision of this page.)

<div id='ideas'>
h2. Ideas
p(. First, blogs and such, where they'll be explained in more detail...
* Technical/professional blog: "Be Freely":{{ page.links.befreely }}
** Knowledgebase, miscellany: "Twenty3Nineteen": {{ page.links.twentythreenineteen }}
* Personal blog, on things spiritual, philosophical, etc: "Formless and Void":{{ page.links.formlessandvoid }} 

p(. My wife says I'm an "idea guy" - I suppose she's right: I work with ideas a lot, and I'm always searching for the best way to implement them. I'm a tinkerer, I use and recommend Open Source software, in part because of the philosophical, social, and economic _ideas_ behind it. I also care about getting important things done right (the first time), quickly. 

p(. I'm thinking increasingly about social problems around the world, many of which are (eventual) results of specific ideas (or combinations and conflicts of them). Recently it's been made very clear to me: if we don't actively make the world a better place, it becomes a worse place - entropy, I suppose. So my "ideas" of late have been related to that active pursuit of a better, more peaceful and prosperous world.
