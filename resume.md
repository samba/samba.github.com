A tenacious, entrepreneurial software and systems engineer, in Seattle, Washington.

I love building excellent software and services, growing business, and the pursuit of quality in engineering.

Analytics and Business Intelligence have been the emphasis of my last several years in consulting and product development. I've worked the world's largest brands in food service and online publishing, and major world-wide brands in travel/vacation, entertainment, consumer electronics, and healthcare industries [to name a few]. I'm thrilled to see strategically valuable decisions made with insights from good data.

Learning aggressively is a passion, and I encourage it in those around me. I strive for continuous improvement, and extending the capabilities of my teams through teaching and knowledge sharing. I endeavor to build stronger, more adept and adaptable teams to support a more agile business.

In the last decade I've helped build two startups, and participated in one's bootstrap growth from just two to 30 staff in 6 years.
