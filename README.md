# A blog.

This is a real blog. You probably *don't* want to clone the whole project outright.
You _certainly_ don't want to publish a full copy of this site on your own, as it's copyrighted.

I provide this repository as a functioning example of using GitHub Pages as a publishing environment, and Docker as the local service environment for on-the-fly testing as I write and tune the site's code/style/etc.
