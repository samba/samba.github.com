I help build stronger, more agile organizations, with <a href="http://sendachi.com">Sendachi.</a> My recent work has been in support of Business Intelligence projects, and the integration of microservices and containerization to advance DevOps and continuous delivery adoption among our clients.

I love teaching, learning, sharing knowledge, and developing stronger teams. I encourage tenacity and aggressive learning in the pursuit of quality, agility, and the development of new strategic capabilities.

I helped build <a href="http://analyticspros.com">Analytics Pros</a> with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/calebwhitmore">Caleb Whitmore</a>. I've enjoyed working with major worldwide brands, supporting their analytics integration, and leveraging data to make their marketing and product work more profitable and exciting. I'm thrilled to see strategically valuable decisions made with insights from good data.

## Projects

- Universal Analytics Measurement Protocol libraries in [Python][1], [C][2], and [PHP][3].
- [trombone][4] - an extensible tool for converting Tomboy notes into Evernote.
- [tackle-wsgi][5] because none of the myriad other WSGI frameworks quite suited my taste.

### As Yet Encumbered

Regrettably much of my work is currently not open-source, owned by employers and clients. This includes several Javascript frameworks, various libraries related to integration and use of Analytics data, and various auxiliary projects to support components of products built.
