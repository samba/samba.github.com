## Culture of *kaizen*

(Alcoa Example)
Habits (keystone, communication)

Lean - consistent, small changes toward a single mission.

## Principles of social change 

(Rosa Parks case)

"Culture starts with community"


## Changing Oneself

- Free will demands change with purpose. 
- Change without purpose is waste.
- Agency without change is also waste.

Self-determination is meaningless without self-awareness, and all self-change is waste without a purpose addressing one's context, especially the people around them. One must adopt a purpose that guides change toward purpose. 

The true ninja is master of himself and his environment.

Free will, self-change, and purpose compose autonomy.

Autonomy, insofar as societies are concerned, demands the ability to change oneself (at the individual level), a sense of purpose, self-awareness
