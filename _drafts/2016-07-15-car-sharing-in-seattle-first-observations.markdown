_Wherein I note the experience of a first-time user of car sharing services *ReachNow* and *Car2Go*._

I'm not the first to discuss the rollout of these services in Seattle; 
[Tech Times also reviewed them in April][1].

I recently had need to get around town without my own car: it was undergoing repair for a few days, 
and I still need to meet my clients occasionally.


Issues:

- Car2Go smart car:
    - wobbly
    - acceleration not very responsive
    - transmission produced a lot of lurching between gears
    - blind spot at left-rear
    - tight handling

- ReachNow mini bushman:
    - limited service area, inconvenient
