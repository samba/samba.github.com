# Leading Software Teams


## Set Team Priorities

Overarching:
1. Constantly build a climate of trust, discovery, and collaborative exploration. 
2. Deliver usable software of increasing quality, quickly and continuously, and don't fret about who's right or wrong along the way.

Ensure that *a few* key objectives and priorities are clear at all times, so the team can independently and individually decide on supportive action. 




## Mentoring & Coaching

Everyone should have a next step, a topic of study and an area of growth. 
Make plans with them to pursue it. Help them find resources. Keep them accountable for their progress.

Most engineers are highly opinionated, but you knew that already. The good ones learn to be humble about it.  
Trouble comes when they invest too much time in debate. 

### Newcomers to the field

Junior members sometimes need specific guidance on *what* to work on, particularly when they're new to a specific technical domain.

A manager should aim to support their growth.
Keep them learning, but keep them succeeding. 
Their morale is an important asset, in motivating their growth and contribution.

Some less experienced folk may be prone to idealism, advocating strong principles in environment where their application may induce greater liabilities.
Help them recognize that all principles and philosophies in our field exist across a spectrum, and that ultimately pragmatism must win.


### Engaging the old hand

Senior members will surprise you, both positively and negatively. 
The trick is keeping them engaged, and helping them grow without offending their sense of independence.
We should probably work on that though: that independence may not be all it's cracked up to be, especially if it leans to arrogance.
