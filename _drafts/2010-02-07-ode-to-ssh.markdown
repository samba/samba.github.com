Dearest SSH,

"Have I told you lately, that I [SSH] you?"

Now is one of those moments when I reflect on how much benefit I get from a particular open-source project. Sometimes it's awk, Linux in general, etc... this time it's SSH.

Some of the things I use SSH for:

- Secure terminal access to my servers (obviously)
- Accessing my music archives from afar (DAAP over SSH)
- Remote Desktop, only much safer (RDP over SSH)
- Safely administering remote databases (MySQL over SSH)
- Safer browsing from other networks - hotels, coffee shops, etc (SOCKS proxy via SSH)

My working environment, with the benefit of SSH:

- Using GNU Screen, I can resume my work anywhere.
- With vim, I can have a sensible programming environment on very low bandwidth
- Git lets me push code around between several machines efficiently
- Rsync (or unison) lets me synchronize and maintain file systems very conveniently
- I issue updates and test code (mostly web apps) from anywhere, as though I were on site

Very rarely do I have to think about security - my SSH configuration lets me focus on business, rather than logistics. (Mind you, I had to think about it in order to set it up the first time, but once it's done, it's wonderful.)

Dearest SSH, Thank you.
