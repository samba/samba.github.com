Did you laugh, when you read that? 

In a past life as an analytics consultant, focused on Google Analytics instrumentation in web and mobile apps, coordinating with vendors was often the single hardest part of supporting a product launch. If only I knew then what I've since learned...

## Workflow that Works, and Flows

As it happens, there are several techniques and disciplines, derived from Lean manufacturing, that are highly applicable. Successfully implementing them remains a challenge, as with third-party vendors, several key dynamics have to be established. 

Folks familiar with Lean will find these to be no surprise at all.

### 0. Focus on the client's end goal

Your client doesn't collect data just to stare at it and admire its beauty. Nope, your client's needs for data are driven by the _need_ to evolve, to adapt, and to change.

What changes? Usually processes, practices, and business systems. These are usually framed around your clients **understanding** of their markets, their positioning, and their value proposition - all of which can also evolve.

Why should it change? The customer's experience of the brand, in the end. (See also: [Product Integrity][2].)


### 1. Make your batches small



### 2. Accelerate and amplify feedback


### 3. Avoid "Design Up Front"

Controlling "Design In Progress" is a key factor 





**Note** annecdotes here are cited from my past life as a consultant focused on Google Analytics. Since then I've found 

In my past work, those third-party vendors were usually software development shops, in some form. They operate on a fixed release cycle, and they avidly resist even the tiniest changes, in spite of claiming that they're "agile." If I'm lucky, that means a request can be fulfilled in 2 weeks. Something goes wrong, and three or four cycles get burned due to human-errors and/or communication failures. Suddenly we've lost 6 weeks against the launch schedule, and we're still "feature complete" on our analytics integration.
