title: Team Leadership is like Gardening
---

In 2017 I accepted my first role formally managing a team in a large corporation, that I did not at least partially own.
This was a profoundly educational time, for myriad complicating external factors, and exactly where I'd want to be to learn some hard lessons. 
That year entailed a great deal of research, particularly on leadership, management theory and (applied) group psychology.
Most impactful on me though, was the opportunity to see the effects of two wildly different management philosophies, in action, in a single group.

## Gardening

At home, I love gardening and landscaping. I love fostering biological life, and sharing its fruits and ambiance with my children. 
I enjoy reshaping my little place on Earth, when there are ways that it can better host that life, and bring joy to my family and friends.

### Outline the Harvest

- Identify the goals of the team
- Identify the people and their goals


### Start seeds in the greenhouse

### Water daily, just enough

### Provide sunshine

### Weeding out distractions

### Pruning new branches


### Thinning the crop

### Fostering Transplants


### Turn the soil


## Some additional highlights...

* Your team will bring their creativity to work, when they share your vision.
* Your team will trust you when you don't know what's next.
* Your team needs you to have a plan.
* Make decisions fast. It's OK to change them later.
* Make decisions together; don't leave anyone behind.
* Make promises and keep them. Be humble when you fail.
* Broadcast your wins, 
* Join your team when they're on the firing line.
* When things aren't working, change how you make decisions (as a team).
* Culture evolves: you manage it, or it manages you.
* Give the team goals - not individuals. Let the team members give you their goals. Help them grow into their goals.
* Influence subtly. Be sparing in overt action.
* People must be motivated to change intrinsically.
* Trust can be restored - and you must drive it.
* Some things must be shown, not merely told.
* Understand and apply OODA and VUCA.
* Understand Deming's 14 points.
* Smile more.
















## Teams need vision, transparency, and hope.

This means you tell your team what's coming, what _you think_ is coming, and you tell them when _you're not sure_. 
But you'd better have _some_ idea, and you *must* be able to articulate specific actions you have in mind to turn the broader 
situation in a way that's advantageous for the company and for the team.

When you lack vision, you will lose people. Like a slippery slope. 
Some managers will tell you that's OK, they're just "managing out" the people who won't simply do what they're told.

Pessimism is viral, but so is optimism. If you want results, however, you need pragmatic, focused, and determined realism with a sprinkling of _hope_.

Hope makes it all work: when people share a _hope_, they start to trust each other in building toward that hope.

## People need promises, fulfilled.

Promises set expectations, and fundamentally, trust is about expectations. 
Trust is learned, though, by you doing what you said you would do - this is basic accountability.

When you make a promise, there are two modes of [vulnerability][1] in play:

- Your team (member) relies on you for something; they are vulnerable.
- You put your reputation on the line; they get to observe outcomes and consistency.


I accept (and must admit) that sometimes promises fail due to external factors. Be humble. Be vulnerable. 
(If you're not sorry that you couldn't keep a promise, you should get that checked.)


## People need decisions.

This one might be the hardest to apply, in daily situations.

Hopefully, your staff often requests to attend conferences that would be useful for their career development. 
This is something you should absolutely support. 

Most likely, and quite unfortunately, corporate budget process will prohibit you from from enabling them directly. 
As a result, you may have to defer the decision "up the chain" and wait for approval, or wait for some altogether uninterested department (e.g. marketing) to decide their plans first.





They don't need to wait months before finding out if they can go to that conference or start that project. Waiting erodes hope and breeds pessimism.

If an employee is passionate about a topic, enough to attend, or even speak at a conference, you should do everything you can to support them. 
But if you're not going to, at least don't keep them hanging! 


## When your staff is on the firing line, you go with them.


## Culture changes; are you guiding it?
