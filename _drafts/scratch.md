I came into the role understanding, as I'd suggest everyone should, that they have a lot still to learn. 
I was constantly reading books, articles and blogs, considering a wide array of perspectives. 

The circumstances of my accepting the role were unfortunate, however:

- A respected leader, who had brought the merry band together, was departing for new horizons.
- Though his staff loved him, a legacy of many broken promises had left the unit exposed to criticism by the executive management tier.
- The executive management tier, located overseas, operated by a very different corporate culture.


It was a mess, to say the least. We "reorganized" three times in eight months. Every week, a new problem within the group would arise. 
There were were very few wins, which the group could claim as their own, and morale slipped steadily.


To abbreviate the story, I'll just highlight a few characteristics of the situation I came into:

- The unit lacked a clear vision, and was struggling to recoup direction after the loss of senior leadership.
- Within the unit, there were deep divisions due to past failures and a lack of accountability, which lead to distrust in various degrees.
- External pressures on the unit dictated frenetic development of poorly planned products.
- The broader organizational context, in a multinational corporation, represented "internal" clients which the group poorly understood.

I'm sure you can imagine a lot of the effects of this situation.
