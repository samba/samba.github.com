Successful teams show strong results, "wins" and high-impact outcomes.
This success requires and produces a dynamic of optimism, which yields a feedback loop within the team and influencing the surrounding organization.
The optimism inspires hope, experimentation, exploration, and imagination of new possibilities - in short, creativity and innovation.
