# Recommended Reading

I find _reading_ is a fundamentally important part of developing one's career, primarily when we _intentionally_ challenge our own ways of thinking.
When consulting with friends and colleagues, I find myself referencing learnings and insights from the books listed below, so hopefully you'll find them equally beneficial.

_... and more_ but this is enough for now. :smile:

You'll notice this list *does not* include a lot of technical resources related to software engineering. 
While I still engage in those topics, I find my career most impacted by understanding the organizational, business, and human psychological drivers.
