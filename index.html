		<h1>Sam Briesemeister</h1>

		<p>So I guess this is a site about me and the things I work on... A lot of information is available about me on the web already, so if you're really curious, feel free to search.

		<h2>Employment</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Current Employer: <a href='www.analyticspros.com'>Analytics Pros, Inc</a></li>
				<li>Side job: <a href='www.usafutura.com'>FE Corporation</a> (my dad's company - site under construction, as always)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>So far I've been: (sr) systems engineer, software developer, IT Analyst 1, student - among others.

			<p>Lately I'm thinking about breaking out and exploring some humanitarian interests. I see myself as a problem solver, so I'm considering logistics, communications, and other facets of running worldwide organizations. (If you know of openings or have ideas, please do contact me.)

		<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
			Let's see - how many shall I list?
			<ul>
				<li>My 'dotfiles' - configuration and settings for my shell environment (in Linux)</li>
				<li>Server administration tools that I use on my home network</li>
				<li>A distributed SSH key management system</li>
				<li>Some scripts and packages to help me provision systems faster (i.e. set up my laptop every time I install a new release of my favorite operating system(s))</li>
				<li>Statistical analysis for log files</li>
			</ul>

			And the tools I use in my work (and these projects)...
			<ul>
				<li>Linux: Gentoo, Debian, Ubuntu</li>
				<li>Google Apps</li>
				<li>Google AppEngine</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Ideas</h2>
			First off, my blogs and stuff
			<ul>
				<li><a href='http://befreely.blogspot.com'>Be Freely</a> (technical, open source, work stuff)</li>
				<li><a href='http://formlessandvoid.blogspot.com'>Formless and Void</a> (philosophical, spiritual, personal thoughts... )</li>
				<li><a href='http://sites.google.com/a/befreely.dyndns.org/twenty3nineteen/'>Twenty3Nineteen</a> (my knowledgebase and miscellany)
			</ul>

			<p>My wife says I'm an "idea guy" - I suppose she's right: I work with ideas a lot, and I'm always searching for the best way to implement them. I'm a tinkerer, I use and recommend Open Source software, in part because of the philosophical, social, and economic <i>ideas</i> behind it. I also care about getting important things done right (the first time), quickly. 
		
			<p>I'm thinking increasingly about social problems around the world, many of which are (eventual) results of specific ideas (or combinations and conflicts of them). Recently it's been made very clear to me: if we don't actively make the world a better place, it becomes a worse place - entropy, I suppose. So my "ideas" of late have been related to that active pursuit of a better, more peaceful and prosperous world.

		<h2>Contact</h2>
		In the interest of minimizing SPAM and retaining some privacy, I'll provide limited means of contacting me directly at this point. Eventually I'll add a contact form to permit a safe means of emailing me.
